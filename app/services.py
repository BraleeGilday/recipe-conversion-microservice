# Core logic for recipes conversions

# User Story 1: As a user, I want to scale my ingredient quantities up or down based on a new serving size so
#   that I can adjust the recipe as needed.

# User Story 2: As a user, I want to convert my recipe between the standard and metric measurement systems
#   so that I can use the appropriate units based on my preference or available tools.

# User Story 3: As a user, I want the microservice to automatically validate the ingredients in a recipe so that
#   invalid or incomplete ingredient data can be detected before processing and does not give me incorrect or
#   unexpected results.
